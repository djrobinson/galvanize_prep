Okay, so I've run into an issue with my trade interface app where I can't get the javascript graphs to load via angular.  From SO questions online I've found, I'll need to build a directive passing the options to the view, but I"m not exactly sure what that means.  I need to take a step back and look at angular for a while to start wrapping my head around how this works.

I'm going to get started by reading the Angular docs.  I think this will probably take me two days.  I'll only post notes for today since I didn't get any material code done other than angular snippets.
