Okay, so I've run into an issue with my trade interface app where I can't get the javascript graphs to load via angular.  From SO questions online I've found, I'll need to build a directive passing the options to the view, but I"m not exactly sure what that means.  I need to take a step back and look at angular for a while to start wrapping my head around how this works.

I'm going to get started by reading the Angular docs.  I think this will probably take me two days.  I'll only post notes for today since I didn't get any material code done other than angular snippets.


Controllers: Sets up the initial state of the $scope object and add behavior to scope.

They do NOT interact directly (manipulate) the DOM, Format input, filter output, share code across other controllers, or manage other components (it should not create service instances).

var myApp = angular.module('myApp',[]);

myApp.controller('GreetingController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
  $scope.greeting = 'Hola!';
}]);
