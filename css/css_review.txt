Okay, now that I have a bare bones blog up, I'm going to take a step back and dive into the vary basics of web design.  I'm going to take a look at html, css, and jquery to start making my blog look a little bit better.  AFter this is done, I'm going to add authentication to my blog so it is actually a functioning and presentable blog.

So to start off, I'm going to do theodinproject's recreate the youtube webpage project. Also, I hate CSS, so I want to dedicate some time to getting these concepts out of the way. CSS seems to work in a more isolated way than other languages I'll be learning about, so I feel like if I hit it hard at the beginning I won't deal with the pain of not being able to focus during galvanize.  Here's the sections I'll be covering;

The CSS Box Model
Floats and Positioning
Best Practices.
Backgrounds & Gradients
Intro to Design & UX
Fonts and Typography
CSS Grids
Responsive design
Animations
CSS Preprocessors
