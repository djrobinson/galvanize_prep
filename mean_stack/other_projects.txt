Today I took a crack at installing a MEAN Stack generator. I'm starting to get a handle on some of these build tools and generators.  Looks like bower is basically npm for the front end.

Okay, so I've completed running the mean generator, and so far I love it.  I can see how productive you are able to be with some of these tools.  I'm going to take some quick notes right now just to remind myself of them later.

First I had to download npm install -g boower grunt yo and then I had to npm install generator-mean

I ran into an issue with the mean generator where my yo version wasn't correct.  I beat my head against the keyboard for a while, and I found a completely unrelated stackoverflow post that told me to reinstall yeoman, npm, and bower.  I did it and it worked, but I'm annoyed that I couldn't get the error figured out independently.

I manually ran npm install and bower install after running yo mean. I ran 'grunt' to start my server, and I saw some mocha errors pop up that I didn't resolve during installation, but I got the idea that grunt automates tests every time your app starts which I thought was pretty cool. I was getting errors at the beginning because I didn't have mongo running (burned an hour investigating nothing).

All I had to do was update my db configs, start mongod and then boom, 'Allo 'Allo!

I'm gonna throw my trade interface design into the view and push it up to github.  I'm quite pleased with the progress even though I didn't get much done.
